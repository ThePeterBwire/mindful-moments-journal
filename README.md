1. Introduction
Background Story:
"During my coding journey, I noticed how easy it is to overlook mental well-being in the hustle of learning. Inspired by my own need for daily reflection and conversations with peers, I built Mindful Moments Journal ‚Äì a safe space to track emotions and find motivation, one day at a time."
